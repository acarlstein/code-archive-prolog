# Prolog code examples from 2010

Prolog is a programming language which works around relations not functions.
Prolog is homoiconic due the structure of its clauses and database that provide it the ability to represent itself.

## Note: 

A language is homoiconic when the language is self-defined. This means that if we run on the interpreter a copy of itself, it should work. Another behaviour of an homoiconic language is to lets the programmer to create, change, and run the code on the fly.
Prolog is not fully reflective, but close, Prolog seems like reflective language because  a program that can resolve a problem by itself by just using relationships, facts, rules, structures, and a database. A fully reflective language should be able to create relationships, rules, structures, and database by itself as needed to find a solution.
